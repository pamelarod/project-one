  <p>The Nano degree will help you think like a programmer by using:
<br>1)	<b>Procedural thinking</b> – correct structure to tell the computer what you want it to do
  <br>2)	<b>Abstract thinking</b> – learning this will remove repetitive work
  <br>3)	<b>Systems thinking</b> – will help you understand how a program will work
  <br>4)	<b>Technological empathy</b> – understanding of all aspects of a computer, how it works and it strengths and weaknesses
  <br>5)	<b>Debugging</b> -  finding out why it is not working and be able to fix it</p>

<p>The 3 major parts of viewing a webpage.<br>
The individual uses a <em>browser</em><b> (explorer/firefox)</b> to access the internet requesting the <em>HTTP</em> from the <em>servers.</em><br>The links between the pages are called <em>Hyperlinks</em> or just links. This is what makes the appearance of the web – the way we view it.</p>

<b>URLS</b> – Uniform Resource Locator – consists of a <em>protocol</em> <b>HTTP</b></em> – <em>a host</em><b> (www.udacity.com)</b> – <em>a path</em> <b>(name of document)</b> 

<p>The <em>HTML Markup</em> consists of an <em>opening tag</em> such as <b>&ltb&gt</b>, the <em>context</em><b>(this is between the opening and closing tags)</b> and the <em>closing tag</em> <b>&lt/b&gt</b>.<br>This grouping is also called an <b>element</b>. <br>
This is how it looks.&ltb&gt the dog &lt/b&gt. the dog would be in bold <b>the dog</b>. Markup changes the text content - what it looks like or how it is arranged.<br>
It also includes references to other documents, text and embedded videos or images.</p></p>

<p>The B tag &ltb&gt is the bold tag. Anything after the &ltb&gt will be bolded and will continue until the closing &lt/b&gt tag is added to the string.<br>
Another tag is the the italics tag  &ltem&gt. It is called an emphasis tag.</p>

To add a hyperlink you would use an anchor tag the A tag &lta&gt. To begin start with the A tag &lta and type in the attribute name <em>href</em> (hyper reference) = (then the link address in quotation) <em>"www.reddit.com"</em> and > to close the opening tag. It would look like this.<br>
&lta href="www.reddit.com"&gt. This is just the opening tag.
<br>Next type in the name that will appear on the web page such as <b>Derp</b> and then the closing A tag &lt/a&gt.
<br>The entire sequence would look like this:<br>
&lta href="www.reddit.com"&gt derp&lt/a&gt<br>
On the webpage the word <b>Derp</b> would be a link to the reddit webpage.</P>

<p>The structure for the image tag:<br> The <em>IMG</em> tag &ltimg&gt is broken down as:
It begins with opening IMG tag &ltimg  then follows the attribution name tag <em>src</em> (source), next the <em>= sign </em>and then the <em>the URL for the image</em> followed by another attribution name tag <em>alt</em><em>=</em><em>"the text"</em>name.<br>
&ltimg src="smiley.gif" alt="smiley face"&gt
<br>The alt=”text” is used if the picture will not load. It is required. This is used if the browser requests a URL that doesn’t exist.<br> What we use for the “TEXT” will be displayed.</p>
You can also add text before and after the image tag so the image will appear within the text.<br>
<p><b>Remember</b>:Anything after the attribution name and the equal sign the link will always be in quotation marks <b>""</b>.</p>

The &lt br &gt, &lt img &gt are examples of void tags. They only need an opening tag and will not have a closing tags.<br>

<p>Whitespace<br>
When you type text and add mark ups regardless of how many spaces you put between the words or how many lines you have, the text will always appear on the same line unless you use the break tag <b>&ltbr&gt</b> or the paragraph tag <b>&ltp&gt</b>.</p>
<p>The differences between the &ltbr&gt tag and the &ltp&gt tag is that the &ltp&gt tag requires a closing &lt/p&gt tag. Both of these will move the text to another line.<br>
If you type the <b>&ltbr&gt</b> tag twice there will be a space between the lines. If you type the <b> &ltp&gt tag</b> once there will always be a space between the two lines of text because it starts a new paragraph.</p>

<p>Inline / block – the inline is the <b>&ltbr&gt</b> tag and the block is the <b>&ltp&gt</b> tag.
The <b>&ltbr&gt</b> tag is ending a line of text and a new line will start no matter how many spaces there are between the &ltbr&gt tag and text. Without the &ltbr&gt or the &ltp&gt the text will  still look like one continuous line.<br>   
Another difference between the &ltbr&gt and the &ltp&gt is that the &ltp&gt makes an invisible box around the text. It can also have height and width dementions while the &ltbr&gt is just text.</p>
Different INLINE elements include <b>&ltb&gt</b> (bold text), <b>&ltem&gt</b> (italics), and <b>&ltimg&gt</b> (images).
